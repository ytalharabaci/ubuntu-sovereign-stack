## Abstract
Enterprise workloads are increasingly bound to hyperscale clouds and their extraterritorial control planes (e.g., CLOUD Act). The Ubuntu Sovereign Stack provides an on-prem, open-source reference architecture that keeps identity, collaboration, and observability fully under organizational custody. It uses Ubuntu Server LTS + Kubernetes (RKE2, containerd runtime) managed by Rancher, Podman for daemonless image builds on admin hosts, Samba 4 + Authentik for identity, Zimbra for mail (experimental), and Wazuh/Prometheus/Grafana for security and metrics. Persistent storage (Longhorn), networking (MetalLB), PKI (Cert-Manager), and backups (Velero + MinIO) complete the platform. Client flexibility is preserved via ten Ubuntu-based desktops tuned to user personas.
