# Project Proposal: Ubuntu-Based Open-Source Sovereign Enterprise Architecture

> *   **Server:** Kubernetes (Rancher)
> *   **IAM/MFA:** Authentik
> *   **Directory:** Samba AD + Zimbra CE
> *   **Client:** Ubuntu LTS and Derivatives

## Abstract
This project presents a fully on-premise, Ubuntu LTS-based open-source enterprise architecture designed to reduce cloud dependence and strengthen data sovereignty. Server-side services run as containers on Kubernetes managed by Rancher; identity and MFA are provided by Authentik; directory and mail services are implemented with Samba 4 Active Directory and Zimbra Community Edition. Security and observability layers rely on Wazuh (SIEM) and Prometheus + Grafana (metrics and alerting). The network perimeter is protected by physical firewalls, and backups are handled by physical appliances (e.g., QNAP NAS). The initiative aims to produce comparative evidence—against Microsoft’s cloud-first ecosystem—across TCO, security, usability, and portability, with a primary legal focus on data residency and sovereignty.

## Vision & Problem Statement
Cloud-first mandates and the U.S. CLOUD Act create extraterritorial exposure even when data is hosted in-region. The goal is an on-prem, open-source stack where compute, identity, keys, and backups remain under the organization’s legal and operational control, avoiding vendor-operated control planes. (*See* [Background Analysis](BACKGROUND_CLOUD_FIRST.md) for legal/strategic context.)

## 1. Introduction
Accelerated digitalization in the public and private sectors has made cloud computing platforms attractive; however, it has also brought critical issues such as **data sovereignty**, privacy, and **Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)** to the forefront. Regulations like the **US CLOUD Act** increase the risk of data being subject to foreign legal demands. Specifically within the Microsoft ecosystem, steps such as the Azure-centric evolution of Windows Server 2019–2025 and the deprecation of WSUS are driving organizations towards hybrid/cloud solutions. This project evaluates an open-source, on-premise architecture against these risks using technical and managerial metrics.

## 2. Background – Microsoft’s Cloud-First Strategy vs. On-Prem Trends
*   **Windows Server 2019:** Focus on sustaining classic on-prem workloads.
*   **Windows Server 2022:** Introduction of Azure Edition, Hotpatch, SMB over QUIC, and Azure Extended Networking – signaling a shift to hybrid/cloud integrations.
*   **Windows Server 2025:** While including AD DS/LAPS improvements, it significantly emphasizes Azure Local/Arc/Entra ID integrations.
*   **WSUS Deprecation:** In 2024, WSUS was deprecated; investment in new features has stopped, and customers are being redirected to Azure Update Manager, Intune, or Autopatch.
*   **Licensing Dynamics:** Core-based licensing and subscription models create long-term budget pressure.

This trend renders on-premise, open-source alternatives strategic for organizations focused on **sovereignty** and **cost control**.

> *For a deeper dive into these trends, see the [Background Analysis: Cloud-First Strategy vs. Data Sovereignty](BACKGROUND_CLOUD_FIRST.md).*

## 3. Purpose and Research Questions
**Purpose:** To design a manageable and reproducible Ubuntu-based open-source enterprise architecture that reduces dependence on cloud providers and strengthens data sovereignty, and to benchmark it against the Microsoft ecosystem.

**Research Questions:**
1.  **TCO Advantage:** What is the cost benefit compared to proprietary licensing?
2.  **Security/Compliance:** What is the level of security (SSO/MFA/SIEM/Vulnerability) achieved?
3.  **Usability & Manageability:** How do Rancher/Kubernetes improve the management experience?
4.  **Data Sovereignty:** How are legal risks regarding data residency reduced?

## 4. Scope and System Architecture
*   **Server Side:** 1× control plane + 2× worker (Ubuntu Server LTS) running RKE2; Rancher for lifecycle, RBAC, and observability. Helm/manifests; CI/CD-ready.
    *   *See [System Architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md) for detailed node and network topology.*
*   **Runtime:** containerd (bundled with RKE2) for Kubernetes workloads; Podman (daemonless/rootless) for image builds and local containers on admin hosts; no Docker daemon.
*   **Storage/Network/PKI:** Longhorn (CSI) for PVCs; MetalLB (L2) for service IPs; Cert-Manager for internal PKI.
*   **Backup:** Velero + MinIO (S3-compatible) for cluster and volume protection; CSI/kopia snapshots; periodic recovery drills.
*   **Client Side:** Ubuntu LTS derivatives (Linux Mint, Zorin OS, etc.) selected based on user experience and deployed via phased pilots.
    *   *See [Tools & Components](TOOLS.md#client-stack-the-flexible-10-model) for the "Flexible 10" model.*
*   **Network Security:** Physical firewall; segmentation/VPN; IDS/IPS options.
